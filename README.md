# school-staff-demographics

<h1>Final Project Proposal</h1>

<h3>Background:</h3>

There is a growing body of research about how a diverse teaching staff benefits all students, and can have particularly important impact on students of color (TS. Dee, 2001; S. Gershenson, 2015; T. Pettigrew, 2006). However, while the number of non-white public school students is increasing across the country, the number of non-white teachers and principals is not. Further, there has been increasing attention paid to the shortage of black school leaders across the country in recent years.

In the 2016-2017 school year, 90.3% of Massachusetts public school staff members reported as white while only 61.3% of students enrolled in Massachusetts public schools reported as white. We would like to use Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE) and American Community Survey (ACS) data to investigate the following questions about school staff demographics. 

<h3>Questions:</h3>

<ol>
<li>What is the breakdown of staff race/ethnicity within the following school employee roles in Massachusetts: principal, administrator, teacher, and support staff? (DESE)</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between the percent of non-white students and percent of non-white staff (in general and by groups mentioned above) in Massachusetts schools? (DESE)</li>
<li>Do schools with the highest percentages of non-white staff members have shared characteristics? We would like to examine the following:<ul></li>
<li>Principal and administrator race/ethnicity (DESE)</li>
<li>Grade levels served (DESE)</li>
<li>Charter versus public (DESE) </li>
<li>Race/ethnicity of residents in zip code (ACS)</li>
<li>Race/ethnicity of public school students in zip code (DESE)</li>
  <li>Median income, percent poverty, and percent bachelorâ€™s degrees by zip code (ACS)</li></ul>
<li>Are there differences in key measures of student success based on staff demographics? To explore this question, we will compare groups of schools with similar student enrollment and different staff demographics and examine the below measures:<ul></li>
  <li>Attendance rates (DESE)</li>
  <li>Student mobility rates (DESE)</li>
  <li>Suspension rates (DESE)</li>
  </ul></ol>

<h3>Potential Extensions:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are additional data points from both DESE and ACS that we could examine, such as average teacher salary by zip code, and standardized test results by school.</li>
<li>Create an visualization of the changing student and staff member demographics by year that can be filtered by zip code or school.</li>
<li>Create a dashboard for school staff members or parents that allows them to see school demographic information and success measures compared to other schools in the district.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Data:</h3>

<b>MA Department of Elementary and Secondary Education Data:</b>

We will use the following reports from the DESE website to access data from the last 5 years:
<ul>
  <li>School addresses and zip codes (to merge with Census data)</li>
<li>Staff race and ethnicity by school, overall and by position</li>
<li>Student race and ethnicity by school</li>
<li>School attendance rates</li>
<li>Percent of students suspended</li>
<li>Student mobility</li>
</ul>

<b>American Community Survey Data:</b>

We will use the <a href=a>2015 ACS 5-year estimates</a> for Massachusetts zip codes to access the following data:
<ul>
  <li>B15003: EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT FOR THE POPULATION 25 YEARS AND OVER</li>
  <li>S1901: INCOME IN THE PAST 12 MONTHS (IN 2015 INFLATION-ADJUSTED DOLLARS)</li>
  <li>B03002: HISPANIC OR LATINO ORIGIN BY RACE</li>
</ul>
